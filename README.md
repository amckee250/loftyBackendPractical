# Lofty Backend Practical 2

### Submitted by: Austin McKee

Django web application that emcompasses the following requirements:

	•	A dockerized Django app with a PostgreSQL database is required, any other tooling or libraries are your choice.
	•	An API endpoint that allows keys to be created as strings with a default integer value
	•	An API endpoint that increments the value of any given key
	•	An API endpoint to list all keys and their corresponding values
	•	An attempt should be made to update incremented values a minimum of 10 seconds, regardless of the number of requests or data currently being processed
	•	A service that populates the database with two dozen images of dogs and any corresponding metadata from the images
	•	An API endpoint that returns two images
	•	A visibly modified image of a dog
	•	The original image that was modified
	•	Any metadata present in the original image
	•	Test coverage over all code where it makes sense
